What is the slope condition for parallel lines?,Parallel lines have the same slope.
What is the slope condition for perpendicular lines?,Perpendicular lines have negative reciprocal slopes (m1 * m2 = -1).
What form should you usually use to write equations of parallel or perpendicular lines through a point?,Point-slope form: y - y₁ = m(x - x₁).
