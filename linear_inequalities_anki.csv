What makes an inequality linear?,"It looks like a linear equation but uses <, ≤, >, or ≥ instead of =."
What special rule do you follow when multiplying/dividing an inequality by a negative?,You must flip the inequality sign.
How do you graph the boundary line for y ≤ mx + b?,Draw line y = mx + b as a solid line (boundary included).
How do you graph the boundary line for y < mx + b?,Draw line y = mx + b as a dashed line (boundary not included).
How do you decide which side of the line to shade for an inequality?,"Pick a test point (usually (0,0)), substitute into the inequality; if true, shade that side, otherwise shade the opposite."
"For y > 2x - 1, why is the line dashed?",Because it is a strict inequality (>) so boundary points are not included.
"For y ≥ -x + 3, why is the line solid?",Because ≥ includes boundary points.
What is the solution region of a system of inequalities?,The overlapping shaded region that satisfies all inequalities at once.
What are the four possible outcomes of a system of inequalities?,"1. Bounded overlap (polygon/wedge), 2. Unbounded overlap (infinite region), 3. Just a line, 4. No solution"
What does “no solution” mean in a system of inequalities?,There is no point that satisfies all inequalities simultaneously (regions don’t overlap).
What does the solution look like when both inequalities point in the same general direction?,An unbounded region extending infinitely (ex: above both lines).
What does the solution look like when one inequality shades above and another below?,A wedge- or polygon-shaped bounded region where shading overlaps.
What does the solution look like when both inequalities collapse onto the same line?,The line itself (all points on the line).
"Why do we test points like (0,0) in linear inequalities?",To determine which half-plane is the solution region.
"How can you check quickly if (0,0) is in the solution region of a system?","Substitute (0,0) into each inequality; it must satisfy all to be in the overlap."
