What is the sliding window technique?	A way to move a contiguous subarray/substring across input while updating results in O(1) per step.
When is sliding window useful?	When the problem involves subarrays or substrings and recalculating from scratch would be too slow.
What are the two types of sliding windows?	Fixed-size (window length is constant) and Variable-size (window expands and shrinks based on condition).
Example of fixed-size sliding window problem?	Find maximum sum of k consecutive elements.
Example of variable-size sliding window problem?	Smallest subarray with sum ≥ target.
Why is sliding window better than brute force?	Avoids recalculating overlapping sections; reduces O(n·k) to O(n).
What data structures often pair with sliding windows?	Hashmaps (to track counts), sets (to track unique elements), and deques (to track max/min).
What is the biggest pitfall in variable windows?	Forgetting to shrink from the left when condition is met.
What is the biggest pitfall in fixed windows?	Forgetting to drop the element that slid out of the window.
What is the time complexity of most sliding window solutions?	O(n).
What is the two pointers technique?	Using two indices to scan an array or string efficiently instead of nested loops.
What are the two main types of pointer movement?	Opposite-direction (inward from both ends) and Same-direction (fast/slow).
When is opposite-direction useful?	In sorted arrays to find pairs or check conditions by comparing both ends.
When is same-direction useful?	In linked lists to detect cycles or find the middle node.
Example of opposite-direction two pointer problem?	Two Sum II in a sorted array.
Example of same-direction two pointer problem?	Detecting a cycle in a linked list.
Why is two pointers better than brute force?	Reduces O(n²) pair scanning down to O(n).
What is the fast/slow pointer trick?	Fast moves 2 steps, slow moves 1 step; if they meet → cycle exists.
How to find the middle of a linked list with two pointers?	Fast moves 2 steps, slow moves 1 step; slow ends at the middle.
Common pitfall when using inward pointers?	Forgetting it requires a sorted array.
What does Big-O notation describe?	It describes how an algorithm’s runtime or space grows as input size n increases (upper bound of growth).
O(1) — Constant Time	Runtime does not change with input size. Example: access array element by index.
O(log n) — Logarithmic Time	Runtime grows slowly, proportional to log of n. Example: binary search.
O(n) — Linear Time	Runtime grows directly with n. Example: scanning an array once.
O(n log n) — Linearithmic Time	Runtime grows as n × log n. Example: merge sort, quicksort average.
O(n^2) — Quadratic Time	Runtime grows as n squared. Example: nested loops (compare all pairs).
O(2^n) — Exponential Time	Runtime doubles with each new element. Example: recursive subset generation.
O(n!) — Factorial Time	Runtime grows factorially. Example: generating all permutations.
Big-O vs Big-Theta vs Big-Omega	Big-O = worst-case upper bound, Big-Theta = tight average bound, Big-Omega = best-case lower bound.
What is the core idea of the Prefix Sum pattern?	Build a running total array `prefix[i] = nums[0] + … + nums[i]` so you can compute any subarray sum in O(1): `sum[l:r] = prefix[r] - prefix[l-1]`
Why use prefix sums instead of recalculating subarray sums?	Brute force subarray sum is O(n) each time. Prefix sums precompute cumulative sums, letting you answer queries in O(1).
What are the main uses of Prefix Sums?	- Fast subarray/range sum queries<br>- Count subarrays with certain properties (sum = k, divisible by k, etc.)<br>- Prefix/suffix products (like LC 238)<br>- 2D range sums in matrices
What is the difference between prefix array vs prefix sum + hashmap?	- Prefix array: Precompute sums → answer range queries directly.<br>- Prefix + hashmap: Store frequencies of prefix sums → count subarrays meeting a condition in O(n).
How does Prefix Product / Suffix Product relate to Prefix Sum?	It’s the multiplicative version: precompute running products instead of sums. Example: LC 238 (Product of Array Except Self).
What is 2D Prefix Sum used for?	Extend prefix sums to matrices. Precompute cumulative areas to query any sub-rectangle sum in O(1). Example: LC 363.

How do you convert slope–intercept (y = mx + b) to standard form?	Rearrange to Ax + By = C, clear fractions, make A &gt; 0.
How do you convert point–slope to slope–intercept?	Expand the RHS, then isolate y.
Process for solving for y in standard form?	1. Move x-term to the other side. 2. Divide through by coefficient of y.
Example — Convert 3x + 2y = 12 to slope–intercept.	y = -3/2 x + 6
Example — Line slope = 3 through (2, -1). Point–Slope form?	y + 1 = 3(x - 2)
