What is the goal of elimination in systems of equations?,"To eliminate one variable by adding or subtracting the equations, leaving a single-variable equation to solve."
When is elimination easier than substitution?,"When both equations have variables with the same or opposite coefficients (like 3x and -3x, or 2y and -2y)."
What do you do if coefficients don't match?,Multiply one or both equations so that one variable’s coefficients match (or are opposites).
True or False: You can choose to eliminate either x or y.,True — pick whichever is easier (smaller numbers or already aligned coefficients).
What mistake happens if you subtract equations inconsistently?,Mixing orders (e.g. subtracting left sides one way and right sides the other) causes sign errors.
"If two equations are identical after elimination, what does that mean?",The system has infinitely many solutions (the lines overlap).
"If elimination produces a false statement (e.g., 0 = 5), what does that mean?",The system has no solution (the lines are parallel).
How do you check your elimination solution?,"Plug your (x,y) into both original equations — both must be true."
What is the general sequence of steps for elimination?,"1) Align equations, 2) Multiply if needed, 3) Add/subtract to eliminate a variable, 4) Solve for the remaining variable, 5) Substitute back, 6) Check."
Why is elimination called the 'addition method'?,Because it often uses addition (or subtraction) of equations to cancel out one variable.
